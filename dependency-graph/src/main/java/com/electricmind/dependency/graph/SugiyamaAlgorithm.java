/**
 * <p>An implementation of Sugiyama's algorithm for graph-drawing.
 *
 * <p>Sugiyama's algorithm for drawing layered, directional diagrams is a very
 * commonly-used method in graph-drawing software.  It was devised by Kozo Sugiyama,
 * and two of his colleagues and is cited extensively.  The algorithm has four
 * main stages:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>Cycle removal: First, we consider cycle removal, the attempt to take a set of
 * relationships, and reverse some dependencies until the relationships are acyclic.
 *
 * <li>Layer assignment and normalization: Next, we assign layers to the nodes of the
 * graph.  Also, at this time, we attempt to normalize the graph by introducing
 * "dummy vertices" that help us handle relationships that span multiple layers.
 *
 * <li>Crossing reduction: Thirdly, we iterate over each layer multiple times,
 * seeking to reorder the nodes with an eye to avoiding lines that cross.
 *
 * <li>Horizontal coordinate assignment: Lastly, we assign an x value to each item
 * in the layer in an attempt to produce the most visually-pleasing graph.
 * </ol>
